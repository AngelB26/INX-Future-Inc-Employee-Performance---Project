# üìä Employee Performance Analysis - Exploratory and Model Evaluation Report

## 1. Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to predict employee performance (Low, Average, High) based on various demographic, professional, and behavioral features using machine learning models. The outcome can help HR departments in decision-making regarding hiring, promotion, and training.
